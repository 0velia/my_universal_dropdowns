Markdown# 🎭 ComfyUI Dynamic Dropdowns & Assistant

A self-contained, high-efficiency custom node system and Windows desktop companion app for ComfyUI. This tool eliminates canvas clutter by consolidating multiple text attribute dropdowns (e.g., hair lengths, colors, styles, outfits, lighting) into a single, cohesive comma-separated output block—serving it simultaneously as a raw string and an encoded conditioning prompt.

## ✨ Features

* **📦 100% Self-Contained Architecture:** No global asset messy paths. The custom node scans its own local `lists/` subfolder, ensuring absolute portability. If you copy the node folder to another machine, it works instantly.
* **🧠 Dual Prompt Injection Engine:** Outputs both a raw `STRING` (for prompt text stacking/debugging) and a pre-tokenized `CONDITIONING` block (to wire directly into KSampler slots, bypassing separate Text Encode nodes).
* **💻 Desktop Companion Utility (`Node Builder Assistant.exe`):** A zero-dependency, hardware-accelerated Windows UI tool that lets you visually build, update, and manage your custom node structures offline without writing a single line of Python.
* **🧼 Automatic Formatting & Cleaning:** The node backend strips out double quotes (`"`), trailing backslashes (`\`), empty rows, and handles string concatenation automatically, preventing messy trailing commas in your generation prompts.

When properly deployed, your project folder maintains this modular layout:

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### Standard User Installation
1. Download this repository or clone it directly into your ComfyUI nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ComfyUI-Dynamic-Dropdowns.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ComfyUI-Dynamic-Dropdowns.git)
   ```bash

Navigate inside the ComfyUI-Dynamic-Dropdowns directory and create an empty folder named lists.

Drop your text-attribute files (e.g., outfits.txt, hairstyles.txt) inside that lists/ folder. Ensure text files feature exactly one choice per line, with no blank trailing lines.

Launch or restart ComfyUI.

🚀 How to Use
1. Generating or Updating Nodes via the Companion App
If you want to configure what dropdown columns display inside ComfyUI:

Double-click Node Builder Assistant.exe right in the root directory.

Click + Add Dropdown Menu for each menu attribute slot you wish to manage.

Assign the text label name (e.g., hair_color) and match it exactly to the .txt file name located inside your lists/ folder.

Click Build Custom Node to generate the node logic.

Click Download Code, save the file, and name it exactly __init__.py, replacing the existing script in the root folder.

2. Canvas Workflow Mapping
Inside the ComfyUI grid canvas interface:

Right-click anywhere and locate your node via Custom Selection -> Universal Text Selector (or your custom display title).

Wire your primary CLIP pipeline dot from your Model Loader directly into the node's clip input dot on the left.

Route your outputs on the right side:

PROMPT_STRING -> Connect this to prompt text combiners, custom wildcards, or visual display text debuggers.

CONDITIONING -> Route this dot directly into your KSampler (positive / negative) inputs, instantly bypassing standard text box nodes.

🛠️ Developer / Compilation Setup
If you want to modify the companion app layout styles or tweak the core source generation engine:

Make your code alterations inside generator/generator.html or generator/app.py.

Open your command terminal inside the /generator folder and execute the one-click compilation automator script:

Bash
python build.py
This script dynamically sets up an isolated Python virtual environment, installs the compression assets, strips module bloat, compiles the new optimized binary, moves it directly to the root path as Node Builder Assistant.exe, and purges temporary cache files automatically.
